                    <strong>Divine Door </strong> is a platform that aims to raise awareness among individuals regarding
                    the direction of their lives, providing guidance and direction to move forward.
                    It acts as a gateway to lead a divine life.

                    If Divine means HIGHER POWER INSIDE, then DIVINE GUIDANCE means that this Higher Power inside of us
                    is willing to
                    guide us every step of the way. Unfortunately, when we don’t ask for Divine Guidance, the Divine
                    lets us play in a dark sandbox until we wake up and pay attention to its existence. If all your life
                    you had to rely on yourself and other humans for all your life answers, you may be oblivious to the
                    fact that the Divine exists, knows you very well, and is willing to guide you in the right
                    direction. In other words, Divine is real, close up, and personal!

                </p>
                <p> Our selection of divine products serves as a means to enhance personal growth and connection with
                    the divine. They function as tools for connecting with the divine.

                                        There is only one hand you can trust — the divine hand of God, the great guiding
                                        force of

                                            At times, when you are feeling <strong> isolated</strong> and everything
                                            seems to be
                                            falling apart despite
                                            your best efforts, people may offer suggestions on how to overcome the
                                            situation.
                                            However, the circumstances are so dire that it feels like everything is
                                            unresponsive and
                                            you feel powerless.
                                            You try to take charge of the situation and take control of people and
                                            events, but your
                                            efforts seem futile.
                                            You receive support from those around you, but it also leaves you feeling
                                            both
                                            strengthened and weakened.

                                        The only thing that keeps you going is <strong><em>HOPE</em> </strong> -
                                        hope that things will eventually get better and everything will work out in the
                                        end.
                                        You feel confused and don't understand why things are getting worse each day.
                                        You eventually reach a point where you feel tired and no longer in control.

                                    <h3><em>Difficult to cross </em></h3>
                                    <p>The sages describe this world as being like a deep ocean that’s wide and
                                        difficult to cross.
                                        They also allude to something on the other side that’s well worth the effort —
                                        an attainment
                                        that is called by terms such as realization, enlightenment, liberation,
                                        salvation, and
                                        nirvana.

                                        Here you are, swimming in the vast waters of worldly life.
                                        You want to get there — to that divine state of liberation on the other shore —
                                        but there’s
                                        no map!
                                        The way is tumultuous and fraught with distractions and illusions. How are you
                                        going to
                                        achieve your goal?

                                        You may swim with great fervor, but how do you know you’re going the right way?
                                        There is no land visible as far as your eyes can see.
                                        At times, the sun disappears behind some clouds, and you’re not even able to see
                                        waters that
                                        are right in front of you.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Open the door</h3>
                                    <p>Trust your inner voice, and it will speak to you more distinctly. When you’re
                                        considering a
                                        particular decision, you can use the following contemplation to ask for
                                        guidance. As always,
                                        feel free to adjust the words to suit your own beliefs and personal nature.
                                    </p>
                                    <pre><code>Example</code></pre>
                                    <p>In a way, it doesn’t matter whether or not your image of divine guidance is
                                        accurate. Divine
                                        guidance doesn’t care if you think it looks like a man with a beard, a woman
                                        with breasts,
                                        an elephant-headed boy, a five-headed god, a blue point of light, or a formless
                                        presence.

                                        What’s most important is for you to find some way to relate to graceful guidance
                                        so that you
                                        can open the door to receiving its blessing.

                                        For example, you don’t need to know all the biological and chemical processes
                                        that go into
                                        creating a stream of water in order to drink from it. However, you do have to
                                        have some way
                                        of knowing that the water is there and available for you to enjoy.</p>
                                    <p>In the same way, you have to discover how divine guidance manifests for you:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        Is this conscious universe teaching you through symbolic hints?
                                        <li>Does your guidance come from within?</li>
                                        <li> Do you feel that celestial beings are watching over you and whispering
                                            hints?</li>
                                        <li> Is an all-powerful Lord revealing your steps as you walk on your path of
                                            life?</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>What’s most important in receiving guidance is your attitude — your stance of
                                        receptivity,
                                        humility, trust, and love, along with your pure intentions of serving and
                                        bringing greater
                                        good to your life and the whole world. These spiritual qualities automatically
                                        draw divine
                                        guidance to you because the universe likes working with those who are in harmony
                                        with its
                                        highest good — just like you do!</p>
                                    <h3>Trust your inner voice</h3>
                                    <p>Divine guidance is an especially important part of the positive creation equation
                                        because:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Intelligence alone doesn’t guarantee that you’re making the right choices in
                                            life. </li>
                                        <li>Earnestness or will power won’t guarantee that you’re taking the right paths
                                            in life.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Friends may offer you a helping hand along the way, but where are they
                                            really helping
                                            you to go?
                                            Divine guidance won’t steer you in the wrong direction or make you go
                                            against your
                                            better judgment. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Sit quietly, calm your mind, and ask or state the following:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>God, is there anything you want to tell me? </li>
                                        <li>Universe, is there any guidance you wish to offer me?</li>
                                        <li>I am open and receptive to learn. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>After repeating these phrases, you may choose to sit quietly and listen for an
                                        inner
                                        guidance, or open a spiritual book and see what message may be there for you.
                                        Truthfully,
                                        the universe can speak through anything. Divine messages can come through
                                        television shows;
                                        via songs on the radio; by walking by and hearing just the right snippet from a
                                        nearby
                                        conversation; or as a small, still voice in your own heart and soul.</p>

                                <p>Simplicity is a perfect realization of life. It is the achievement of something on
                                    which
                                    we work so hard.
                                    A person’s essential being that distinguishes him or her from others can make or
                                    fail
                                    him or her.
                                    Bringing simplicity into being is highly difficult since it involves working on and
                                    with
                                    the self and goes on working throughout life. Perhaps, this kind of realization of
                                    simplicity made Steve Jobs put into words, “that’s been one of my mantras – focus
                                    and
                                    simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your
                                    thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get
                                    there, you can move mountains.”

                                    <p>Simplicity is always easy to understand. It makes doing stand uncomplicated and
                                        effortless.
                                        <strong>Simplicity is about the best. </strong>
                                        It never compromises and under no circumstances accepts the standards that are

                                    This develops into the tendency because of which a person likes and looks interested
                                    in
                                    something.

                                <h3>‘A perfect realization of life’</h3>
                                <p>Simplicity is connected with ‘being uncomplicated’ and ‘making things uncomplicated’
                                    and
                                    brings them together
                                    disallowing nonessential changed and diverse parts to emerge from unproductive
                                    objectives involving complications. </p>
                                <h3>Real treasure</h3>
                                <p>Simplicity is a real treasure. When it becomes the much loved and highly valued
                                    quality
                                    for an individual,
                                    the person starts a search for this buried treasure within. One has to bury oneself
                                    in
                                    real hard work and
                                    goodness to have this treasure. This is the only way to have it.
                                    One has to possess it to enjoy it and other treasures like it. That is why Lao Tzu
                                    treasured simplicity which is evident in,
                                    “I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. These three
                                    are
                                    your greatest treasures.”
                                </p>

                                    discerning
                                    them superficially,
                                    invent the rational mind,
                                    continue delivering what is rightfully expected and what is right, and live to get

                                <p>This application shows that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,

                                    understanding ‘willingness is meaningless without doing’, and valuing authenticity

                                <p>Gratitude is a positive emotion that involves being thankful and appreciative and is
                                    associated with several mental and physical health benefits. When you experience
                                    gratitude,
                                    you feel grateful for something or someone in your life and respond with feelings of
                                    kindness, warmth, and other forms of generosity.</p>

                                <p>Practicing <a href="#">Gratitude</a>, is as easy as saying thank you for life's
                                    blessings,
                                    and the sooner you start, the sooner you'll start reaping the benefits of
                                    gratitude—of which there are plenty, by the way.

                                    their lives.
                                    In the process, people usually recognize that the source of that goodness lies at

                                <h3>Be thankful</h3>

                                <p>"[Gratitude] puts us into communication and communion with the world around us (often
                                    as represented by other people)," Borg says. "[It] can lead to a cycle of
                                    giving and receiving that becomes reciprocal and can lead to a state of feeling and
                                    being in mutuality with the world."</p>

                                <p>In psychology, an attitude refers to a set of emotions, beliefs, and behaviors toward
                                    a particular object, person, thing, or event.</p>
                                <hr>
                                <p>Attitudes are often the result of experience or upbringing. They can have a powerful
                                    influence over behavior and affect how people act in various situations. While
                                    attitudes are enduring, they can also change.
                                    The main components of attitude are cognitive, affective, and behavioral, which
                                    means they incorporate thoughts, feelings, and actions.</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>An attitude is a <strong>positive, negative, or mixed evaluation </strong> of an
                                        object expressed at some level of intensity. It is an expression of a favorable
                                        or unfavorable evaluation of a person, place, thing, or event. These are
                                        fundamental determinants of our perceptions of and actions toward all aspects of
                                        our social environment. Attitudes involve a complex organization of evaluative
                                        beliefs, feelings, and tendencies toward certain actions.</p>

                                <p>An <em> attitude</em> is a mental and neural state of readiness, organized through
                                    experience, exerting a directive or dynamic influence upon the individual’s response
                                    to all objects and situations with which it is related.</p>
                                <h3>Definition of Attitude </h3>
                                <p>Attitude is the manner, disposition, feeling, and position about a person or thing,
                                    tendency, or orientation, especially in the mind.
                                </p>
                                <h3>How Psychologists Define Attitudes</h3>
                                <p>Psychologists define attitudes as a learned tendency to evaluate things in a certain
                                    way. This can include evaluations of people, issues, objects, or events.
                                    Such evaluations are often positive or negative, but they can also be uncertain at
                                    times.</p>

                                <p>For example, you might have mixed feelings about a particular person or issue.
                                    Researchers also suggest that there are several different characteristics that make
                                    up attitudes.</p>
                                <h3>Attitude Formation</h3>
                                <p>Several factors can influence how and why attitudes form, including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Experience.</li>

                                    <li>Changing to Match Behavior.</li>

                                </ol>
                                <p> Attitudes can form through direct experience, social influence, formal education,
                                    conditioning processes, and observation.</p>
